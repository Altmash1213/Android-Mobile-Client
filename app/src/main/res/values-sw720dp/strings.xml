    <string name="aboutus_text">We are a tech-for-impact organisation : A team of engineers, clinicians, management and public health experts. We\'ve developed an innovative open source telemedicine platform connecting the last mile population. \n\n Mission: We deliver quality healthcare where there is no doctor \n\n Our vision is Health for all. \n\nWe believe in the vision of universal health coverage - that you should be able to receive the health services you need, when and where you need them, without facing financial hardship. We believe in the vision of Universal Health Coverage - that you should be able to receive the health services you need, when and where you need them, without facing any financial hardship (WHO). But realizing this vision requires the collective efforts of an entire ecosystem. We aim to be a catalyst to empower existing health programs to deliver last-mile healthcare through well-designed user-centered telemedicine technology and implementation services. One thing that people donâ€™t understand is that telemedicine is very empowering for women. For a woman living in rural India, health access is a privilege more than a right. Her access to health may be controlled by other people like her husband or in-laws. She has to rely on them for the permission, money, and transportation that she needs to get to a doctor in the nearby city. When I started working on Intelehealth, I was deeply touched by seeing how empowered women felt to be able to walk out of their house to a telemedicine clinic, talk to a doctor and get the care they needed on their own terms. I saw a woman beaten black and blue by her husband, whose in-laws would not give her any money to treat her injuries. The local health worker with the help of a remote doctor was able to assess her injuries, she gave her medicines to manage her pain, ointments to treat the scratches on her body and most important a kind and caring ear to soothe her soul. I met a woman whose husband refused to use any form of birth control and who wanted to speak with a doctor to understand what family planning options she could use. She discussed over teleconsultation various options and ultimately chose an IUD, which the local nurse was able to insert. I resonated deeply with the stories of these women. As a woman who has experienced abuse, I cannot express what it means to have this one thing - the ability to care for your own body - be in your control. I continue to be motivated by the power of telemedicine in creating easily accessible, safe spaces for women to get the care they rightfully deserve. \n\n Neha Verma \nCEO and Co-Founder, Intelehealth</string>
